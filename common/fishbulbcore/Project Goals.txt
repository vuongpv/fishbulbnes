nes showdown, stage 1	
(focus on donkey kong)
thread out machine execution, callbacks for rendering and input

run real time (implement frame/pixel skipping)
	-optimization of cpu engine
		-externalize debugging features
	-codegen switch statement to replace delegate silliness
	
input device emulation

sound
	?? TBI: stream nes sound channels to wav files? investigate nsf players approaches
stage 2	
(focus on other carts)
perfect(tm) timing
